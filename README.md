i intend to personalize it to my own preference, however that will only happen after the core features have been implemented

### AI usage disclosure

some aspects of the development of the original [Coin Coffer](https://github.com/lumipate-sh/coin-coffer) app were made with the use of generative artificial intelligente, namely in the generation of dummy data to test the app, the implementation of some functions and debugging and refactoring sections of code.
artificial inteligence, however, had no role in the design decicions of the app regarding features, functionality, features and overall development.
